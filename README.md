# 21404-Images-Human-Posture-Detection-Data-in-Home-Scenes

## Description
21,404 images - human posture detection data in home scenes. The data scenes are 101 different indoor hone scenes. The gender distribution includes male and female, the age distribution is ranging from young to the elderly, the middle-aged and young people are the majorities. The data diversity includes multiple scenes, multiple time periods, multiple collecting heights, multiple human body occlusions, multiple collecting distances. For collection content, the human body postures data in different home scenes were collected, the human bodies were lying flat, lying on its side or lying on its stomach. For annotation, human body rectangular bounding boxes were annotated. The data can be used for tasks such as human body detection in home scenes.
